## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Stony Brook University, supervised by [Dr. Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/).

<span style="color: red;">*I'm currently seeking a 2025 summer internship and am open to topics related to LLM. Please feel free to contact me!*</span>

## Research Interests

My expertise is in ensuring the Safety and Trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs). I work on identifying Security Challenges and developing Defensive Strategies to protect these models from adversarial threats. My recent work includes:
* Security Challenges -- Investigate vulnerabilities in **LLM watermarking** and **GraphRAG**; use long CoT to **jailbreak reasoning model** and propose advanced methods to address these weaknesses.
* Defensive Strategies -- Develop methods to **defend against backdoor attacks* (self-defense mechanisms in agent)** and **jailbreaking (Data curation when finetuning and KV eviction when inference)**.
  
In addition, I possess extensive expertise and a strong interest in **post-training, prompt engineering, inference optimization, LLM agents, and ensuring LLM alignment.**

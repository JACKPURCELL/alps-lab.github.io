### Howdy!


I am Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Lehigh University. I am broadly interested in
 machine learning, computational privacy, and cyber-security. My current research focuses on:
 * understanding privacy and security breaches of machine learning-powered systems
 * building rigorous, yet practical, solutions to mitigate such threats

 I direct the [Algorithmic Learning, Privacy and Security]({{ site.baseurl }}/alps) (ALPS) Lab.

### Recruiting

I am **always** looking for motivated and bright Ph.D. and M.Sc. students. If you know how to build/hack machine learning systems, we should talk! Please email me your resume and set up a time to discuss your potential fit to our group.

I am **not** looking for interns or other short-term visitors.
So please do not contact me about such opportunities, unless I have
explicitly contacted you, your advisor, or your school.

### Short Bio

I joined Lehigh in Fall 2015. Before that I was a Research Staff Member at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. I obtained my Ph.D. from Georgia Tech under the supervision of Dr. [Ling Liu](http://cc.gatech.edu/~lingliu). I did my undergraduate studies in my home country, China, at Zhejiang University.

I am now affiliated with [Data X](http://www1.lehigh.edu/datax/), an interdisciplinary initiative that pushes the envelop of data analytics research.
